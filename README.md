# Go to Spec

This extension allows you to switch between your code and its test file like Intellij IDEs.

This extension is agnostic to the language that you are coding. I have been using with `.rb` and `.js` code with no problems.

## Features

* You can switch from code to spec file.
* You can switch from test to code.

## Using

Calls `Go to Spec` command (cmd+shift+t or ctrl+shift+t).

#### Go to spec

#### Go to code

* Your spec may be anywhere in the workspace. You can specify spec file patterns in settings.
